## ðŸŽ¯ API Endpoints

### Core API Routes
- `GET /` - API status and health check
- `GET /health` - System health monitoring
- `POST /api/ai/upload` - Video file upload
- `GET /api/ai/process/{file_id}` - Process uploaded video
- `GET /api/ai/results/{file_id}` - Get detection results
- `WebSocket /api/ws` - Real-time communication

### Alert Management
- `GET /api/alerts` - Get active alerts
- `POST /api/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alerts

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simple_api.py
# Server runs at http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend1
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173
```

### Full System
1. Start backend API server on port 8000
2. Start frontend development server on port 5173
3. Access the application at http://localhost:5173
4. Upload videos to see AI detection in action

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Features

### Video Upload & Analysis
- Drag-and-drop video upload interface
- Real-time upload progress tracking
- Automatic AI analysis initiation
- Interactive detection overlay with bounding boxes

### Live Detection Display
- Color-coded risk assessment:
  - **GREEN**: CLEAR - No threats detected
  - **AMBER**: CAUTION/SLOW_DOWN - Moderate risk
  - **RED**: EMERGENCY_BRAKE - Critical threat
- Confidence scores and distance estimation
- Time-to-collision calculations

### Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time system status monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Detection history and statistics
- Quick action buttons for system management

### Alert System
- Multi-level alert priorities (INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY)
- Sound notifications (configurable)
- Alert acknowledgment and dismissal
- Location-based alert mapping
- Alert history tracking

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### API Configuration
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8000/api/ws`
- Upload directory: `Backend/uploads/`
- Results directory: `Backend/results/`

### Detection Parameters
```javascript
MIN_CONF_DEFAULT = 0.40    // Minimum confidence threshold
WHITELIST_CLASSES = [      // Monitored object classes
  "person", "car", "truck", "motorcycle", "bicycle",
  "cow", "buffalo", "dog", "sheep", "goat", "elephant", "train"
]
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### Enhanced Video Player
- Custom video controls with frame navigation
- Interactive detection overlay
- Real-time risk assessment display
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Dashboard Components
- Live metrics cards with trend indicators
- Real-time status monitoring
- Performance graphs and statistics
- Quick action buttons

### Alert Components

## ðŸ“Š Mock Data System

The implementation includes a sophisticated mock detection system that generates realistic:
- Bounding box coordinates
- Object classifications
- Confidence scores
- Risk assessments
- Distance estimations
- Time-to-collision calculations

This allows full demonstration of the UI and user experience without requiring actual AI model dependencies.

## ðŸ”® Integration Ready

The system is designed for easy integration with the actual YOLO detection model:
1. Replace mock detection system with real YOLO inference
2. Update `api_server.py` with full dependencies
3. Configure model paths and parameters
4. Deploy with production-grade infrastructure
